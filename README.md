This is the official PyTorch implementation of FlexWorld: Progressively Expanding 3D Scenes for Flexiable-View Synthesis.

## Installation
For complete installation instructions, please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Usage
Static scene video generation given an image and a camera trajectory:

```bash
# You can utilize our CamPlanner class to freely construct the desired trajectory at line 13 in the `video_generate.py` file.
python video_generate.py --input_image_path ./assets/room.png --output_dir ./results-single-traj
```

A flexible-view 360Â° scene generation given an image.
```bash
# You are free to modify the corresponding YAML configuration file by name in `./configs/examples`.
python main_3dgs.py --name room2
```

## ToDo List
- [ ] A user manual for our camera trajectory, offering support for more flexible trajectory inputs and accommodating a wider variety of trajectory types (such as RealEstate camera input and DL3DV-10K camera input).
- [ ] A 3DGS viewer for generated results.
- [ ] Training code for video diffusion model.
